# ðŸ’¼ Employee Salary Prediction

## DescriptionîˆƒThis project involves developing a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on their experience, test scores, and interview scoresîˆ„îˆƒThe model is trained using **linear regression** and is deployed via a **Flask** web application, allowing users to input employee data and receive salary predictionsîˆ„îˆ†

## Features
-îˆƒPredicts salary based onîˆ„îˆ†
  -îˆƒYears of experiencîˆ„îˆ†
  -îˆƒTest scorîˆ„îˆ†
  -îˆƒInterview scorîˆ„îˆ†
-îˆƒInteractive web interface for user input and salary predictioîˆ„îˆ†

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```bashîˆƒpip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flasîˆ„
```
îˆ†

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MSenhoury/ML_project.git
   ```
îˆ†
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ML_project
   ```
îˆ†
3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
îˆ†

## Usage
1. **Train the model:**
   -îˆƒRun `model.py` to train the linear regression model using the provided dataset (`hiring.csv`). The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`îˆ„îˆ†
2. **Start the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
îˆ†
3. **Access the web application:**
   -îˆƒOpen your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`îˆ„îˆ†
   -îˆƒInput the employee's experience, test score, and interview score to receive a salary predictionîˆ„îˆ†

## Project Structure
- `app.py`:îˆƒContains the Flask web application codeîˆ„îˆ†
- `model.py`:îˆƒTrains the linear regression model and saves it using the `pickle` libraryîˆ„îˆ†
- `hiring.csv`:îˆƒDataset containing employee experience, test scores, interview scores, and corresponding salariesîˆ„îˆ†
- `model.pkl`:îˆƒSerialized linear regression modelîˆ„îˆ†
- `templates/`:îˆƒDirectory containing HTML templates for the Flask applicationîˆ„îˆ†
- `requirements.txt`:îˆƒLists the Python packages required to run the projectîˆ„îˆ†
- `Procfile`:îˆƒSpecifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup (used for deployment)îˆ„îˆ†
- `request.py`:îˆƒContains code to send requests to the Flask application (optional)îˆ„îˆ†

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:**îˆƒPythoîˆ„îˆ†
- **Libraries:**îˆƒNumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flasîˆ„îˆ†
- **Web Framework:**îˆƒFlasîˆ„îˆ†
- **Deployment:**îˆƒRender (as indicated by the Procfileîˆ„îˆ†
