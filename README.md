# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction

## Description
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on their experience, test scores, and interview scores. The model is trained using **linear regression** and is deployed via a **Flask** web application, allowing users to input employee data and receive salary predictions.

## Features
- Predicts salary based on:
  - Years of experience
  - Test score
  - Interview score
- Interactive web interface for user input and salary prediction

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MSenhoury/ML_project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ML_project
   ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Train the model:**
   - Run `model.py` to train the linear regression model using the provided dataset (`hiring.csv`). The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.
2. **Start the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. **Access the web application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Input the employee's experience, test score, and interview score to receive a salary prediction.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Contains the Flask web application code.
- `model.py`: Trains the linear regression model and saves it using the `pickle` library.
- `hiring.csv`: Dataset containing employee experience, test scores, interview scores, and corresponding salaries.
- `model.pkl`: Serialized linear regression model.
- `templates/`: Directory containing HTML templates for the Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
- `Procfile`: Specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup (used for deployment).
- `request.py`: Contains code to send requests to the Flask application (optional).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Deployment:** Render (as indicated by the Procfile)
